## How this package was proved

It was extracted into a fresh temporary directory outside the source tree,
with `STATEPROOF_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` removed from the
environment, and the whole offline workflow was run there:

| Step | Result | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | passed | 3.3 s |
| `pnpm typecheck` | passed | 4.7 s |
| `pnpm test` | FAILED | 14.1 s |

Install took 3.3 s.

**RESULT: FAILED**

## Verifying the archive

```bash
sha256sum -c stateproof-submission-final.sha256
```

Then extract it and follow `docs/judge-quick-start.md`.
